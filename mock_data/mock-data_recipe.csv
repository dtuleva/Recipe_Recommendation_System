I have a few tips though to make these sandwiches easier and healthier. For the bread, you can use any sturdy bread.  Spray one side of each slice of bread with no-stick spray before putting it on the grill. For the pesto, Classico makes a very strong jarred pesto and you only need 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of it on a sandwich, which lightens it up significantly. Sliced turkey lunch meat is easier to handle and you don't have to cook something special before hand, and thinly sliced bell peppers stay in the sandwich better. I don't usually put cheese on mine, but I put a thin slice of mozzarella on my boyfriend's turkey pesto paninis. Mozzarella is lower in fat and calories than Monterey jack.

All I wanted/craved was her bierocks. I couldn't get a hold of her for her recipe, so I searched until I found Pam's and thought it was close to what I remembered, so I gave it a shot. \n\nI'm so glad I found this recipe, & so is the hubby he can't get enough of them. I've always added diced potatoes to the filling (something my Mum always put in hers) & over the years, I've adjusted the seasoning to our taste. It might sound weird, but I also add red pepper flakes (just enough for a little kick). The bread has a slight sweetness &, in our opinion, goes perfectly with the pepper flakes. Also, I think it's worth noting, that the bread always comes out so light and fluffy. It looks like a heavy dish, but when we're done eating we feel content, not stuffed or sleepy. \n\nThanks for the recipe, I've been able to get a taste of home no matter where I am."", 'followingCount': 0}, 8359671: {'rating': 5, 'followersCount': 10, 'madeRecipesCount': 16, 'favoritesCount': 179, 'dateLastModified': u'2014-11-07T20:27:37.41', 'text': u'These turned out very good.

Most of the time when I am cooking, I never measure ingredients so I added these to taste while browning the ground beef.

About halfway through their baking time, I used a basting brush to coat the rolls with a touch of leftover bacon/sausage grease.  Gave them character and they came out golden brown!

I used a pound of ground beef, and a half pound of hot sausage.  I removed a little so I could sample it relatively unmolested.  To the remainder I added some paprika to it, some Worcestershire, a little white wine,salt, pepper, and some MSG.  It still tasted relatively flat before putting into the bread and baking it even with the extra seasoning.  I can\'t say there was a huge difference in the fillings and I couldn\'t really tell you which was which once I put some mustard on it.  One was slightly more savory when eating without mustard.  \n\nI used 1 Pepperidge farm butter flaky crescent, 1 Pilsbury regular crescent, and 1 Pilsbury French loaf.  \n\nThe crescents were individual and looked neater, they tasted good.  You can\'t get a lot of filling into them, however.  Maybe a tablespoon and a half.  \n\nThe French Loaf I did all in one shot.  I rolled it out and put a lot of filling in it. and then pinched the edges and layed them on the seam so it would hold together easier.  It came out much juicier due to the increased amount of filling.  If you got a 4-5"" piece, it held together fine.  If you are going to do this for a party or something, I think making individual serving would be the right thing to do.\n\nOverall, I loved them.  I think the french bread was better than the crescents.  A sweeter bread would of probably been great.\n\nI served this with horseradish mustard, curry mustard, dijon mustard, and spicy brown.', 'followingCount': 0}, 4670904: {'rating': 5, 'followersCount': 0, 'madeRecipesCount': 9, 'favoritesCount': 375, 'dateLastModified': u'2010-09-20T06:21:09.603', 'text': u'my mom has made these little treats for years. only she uses diced pork roast.  still very delicious.  even my polish husband loves these.', 'followingCount': 0}, 221114: {'rating': 5, 'followersCount': 1, 'madeRecipesCount': 34, 'favoritesCount': 314, 'dateLastModified': u'2009-09-16T18:53:35.203', 'text': u""Alright, I have been dying to review this recipe since only hours ago when I found it.

I\'ll try cooking the chicken; then vegs; then removing & adding flour; then the cream or half & half.  Don\'t get me wrong, it was good, but thin.  \'Wasn\'t spicy enough for me.  It was ""mild"" on the scale of ""mild, medium, hot, extra hot"".  Something to remember, if you have leftovers, the sauce spices up overnight.

I used a pint of lite sour cream instead of the cream as others suggested and it worked great!  I was glad to lighten it up.  Since we had some left over, I did notice the sauce was not enough.  Next time I would use 16oz of sour cream (as I love the sauce) and just boost up some of the spices.  Plus, I like my peppers well cooked, so I sauteed them longer until soft.

I used skim milk w/ cornstarch instead of heavy cream. I thought my sauce was too thick while others complained of it being too thin, so I suppose it was my fault. Just be careful when using milk and cornstarch. Add the cornstarch very slowly because for some reason this thickened very fast. Next time I'll add some chicken broth to the sauce as well. I read that some people used lemon juice, but I just went with lemon pepper and it was fine. I sauteed the chicken (and company) with EVOO instead of butter. I added a bit of minced garlic in with the peppers because we love garlic. I used maybe half of 1 green and half of 1 red pepper. Using two full peppers would have been way too much. I skipped the green onion and went with regular, white onion. Also skipped the mushrooms. I used the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site for the cajun seasoning. I cut the chicken into strips so the pieces would have more flavor. I shook them in the bag and also added a bit while the chicken cooked. The cook time for the chicken was a bit longer than suggested, so I imagine full breasts of chicken would take even longer.

I did let mine rest a bit to let the flavors really come out and not just have a hot bowl of food.  My only deviation on this was I used maple sausage and green tabasco and thats because it's all i had at home.  I probably went heavy on the proteins but really its got good balance.  For someone who's always looking for good food and not stuff thats all saused up this is nice.     \nOne other thing I did different was my chicken was some I had smoked up the weekend earlier.  \n\nBut still this is very good and I'll make it again, and again, and well maybe again."", 'followingCount': 0}, 22883775: {'rating': 5, 'followersCount': 0, 'madeRecipesCount': 1, 'favoritesCount': 5, 'dateLastModified': u'2017-12-05T23:00:17.897', 'text': u'This was such a hit with my family that I had to make it two nights in a row!

(Another option, place beef in another pan along side of veggies/broth.)  Roast in an open pan until meat thermo. reads 150*, usually 45 to 60 minutes.  Remove meat only to platter; cover with foil to ""rest"" 10 min. until internal temp. reaches medium at 155*.  Return veggies to oven with increased temp. to 425* with red pepper added at this time.  Bake until veggies are tender & lightly browned, approx. 20 min.    Be careful not to dry out the veggies, esp. the potatoes.  It may take a bit of experimenting to get them to your desired doneness.  Meat is best sliced thin across the grain. It is tender & flavorful if not overcooked.  Serve with sauce spooned over slice beef & veggies.  Makes a great leftover beef sandwich the next day.  I have been known to warm leftover beef in bar-b-que sauce for sandwiches the following day.

Also, one stalk of celery way too much for this household. Instead went to the spice section and got Celery Seed, which did very well, smelling and tasting fresh. Ate on hoagie rolls.

Instead of chunks, I slice them consistently at 3/4"" and add a little extra if I have it. If simmered at the right temperature (slightly below medium with my stove/pot combo), they come out with a lovely texture. I see a lot of people who said they skipped out on the zucchini or used a substitute. If your instinct is to do so, please try the recipe as written first (with natural peanut butter). I promise it\'s worth it. The chicken is impossible to mess up, though I\'ve found that it comes out most tender when I simmer it with the vegetables for the full 40 minutes. The spice level is fairly low. I\'m planning on throwing in a serrano on top of the poblano next time to see how it does with a little kick. This recipe is a bit time consuming overall but very worth it.\n\nI have one vegetarian in the household who doesn\'t particularly like tofu, so I made a batch for them using a can of... chick peas... as a substitute for the chicken. If you decide to try this, you will need extra broth (and probably veg instead of chicken) as it gets very thick. I can\'t say I like it that much (I find the oil from the chick peas adds an undesirable flavor to the mix and the lack of chicken broth is another strike), but my vegetarian said she loved it so I thought I would make mention of the modification.

It was pretty dry, so most people will probably want to make the accompanying gravy (we skipped it; just not gravy people).  It's tough to describe, but worth a try if you're looking for something different to use a chuck roast; it was fall apart/shreddy tender.  I served it over wild rice with roasted broccoli.

My husband and I used a little of the gravy but the teens would not use it.  It was just too spicy.

This dish would make so much more sense separated on the plate as a poached chicken breast, some sauteed mushrooms, some fresh celery, and some rice made with the curry/celery/chicken stock.  Sour cream on the side, a soup of your choice as a starter.  \n\nIt certainly needs more stock/liquid--the texture of the dish straight out of the oven was poor (dry and crusted on top).  I also used less of the seasoning package and it still was quite salty.  The taste was good to quite good, but the presentation was poor.  You couldn't quite tell what the dish was and the yellow cast from the curry gave it a kind of unhealthy yellow/grey cast.  I did all the preparation the day before and the baking the next day as I ran out of time.  Certainly most suitable for your family at home, but I wouldn't take it to a party.\n\nUpdate:  Sept 12, 07:  great news!  I tried it as a 'skillet' dinner--\nsaute sliced onions on medium in a skillet and start rice in a saucepan. Add small, cubed chicken pieces to skillet and cover with lid to keep the juices in.  Add curry powder and celery (if using), white wine (if using) and stir often.  When the rice is almost done add the mushrooms, can of condensed soup, and sour cream to skillet.

A few tips though: before you cook your rice, wash it a few time to get the extra starch off, this will also help it from becoming mushy.  The best thing is to use leftover rice you've cooked the night before.  IT TRULY TAKES THE TASTE TO ANOTHER LEVEL, TRUST ME!!!

LOTS OF CHANGES COMING, IF YOU ARE A HATER, KEEP CLICKING, LOL! I  really, really liked this.

Also, I didn't add onion because my kid wouldn't eat it, and I missed that too!  Was worried that the soy sauce was too much, but it was spot on.  Just an  FYI, i totally did a different cooking method and  this recipe was very flexible and user friendly!  I followed the method for oven baked rice ( from this site), used raw rice that I toasted in the pan , and boiling home made chicken broth for the water. I reduced the water by half a cup to make room for the soy sauce. Then I baked it at  350* for 25 minutes or so.  My son really loves spam, sweet peas, carrots and corn, so that is what I used. Oh, how I wished I had celery, that would have rocked! Some colorful red peppers would be nice for flavor and also presentation, too.  I did not add egg as other reviewers suggested, but I am curious if I could have baked that into the rice. I will try that next time! To be fair, what I made was more of an Asian inspired rice pilaf, but I am a happy camper, so why not??? I would have never thought of using spam were it not for this recipe, so I am so grateful to Christine M. for posting this. We could be friends!   This recipe is such A KEEPER! Try it!

Here's what I did: Feeding 6 family members, so I quadrupled the recipe yet still changed a couple things... for 6 large boneless skinless chicken breasts with rib meat, I melted 11 T butter in sauce pan. Added the onion powder (just under 1/4C - I know it sounds like a lot), added a half to three-quarters cup of brown sugar, added what was left of my worcestershire sauce (1 to 2 tsp), added a bunch of shakes of soy to make up for the worcestershire I was missing (maybe a quarter cup). Then added just under a half cup yellow mustard. heat and stir till smooth. Sweet and tangy and awesome. Tasted so good, that I was afraid to add the ketchup, so I didn't. Set a small amount aside for dipping. Marinated the breasts (could have added another one or 2 breasts) for a couple hours then grilled to perfection.

I'm not usually crazy about mustard in my dishes, but it's great in this one. The mustard-leavings in the pan were wonderful in the sauce. I made 1-1/2 times the sauce because it's so amazing. I added 2 cloves of garlic in with the shallots, and after reducing the sauce, I added 1-1/2 Tablespoons of fresh thyme. Mushrooms would have been good, but I forgot to buy them.

Good base recipe.  I found that trying to brown the pork with the mustard resulted in more steaming in the stove top pan than browning.

I also found the cooking time to be way too long! I used 2.75 lb total weight for the 2 tenderloins. I felt it was over cooked using the stated timing. Luckily pork tenderloin is very forgiving, and it was still excellent. I think a higher temperature (to brown the mustard on it in the oven) for quite a bit less time is the way to go. I also took the suggestion of others and added in a 8oz pkg of mushrooms (16 oz probably would be even better) saut\xe9ed in the pan in butter before adding the shallots. Then added 3 cloves minced garlic. (It was the perfect amount! -about 1 tbls minced. It's not too much!) There was no mention of resting the meat and the wonderful oven pan juices! I removed pork to a platter to rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. I poured all of the oven pan juices into to cream sauce, and reduced it further.

This got rave reviews from the family. I felt like we were dining at a 5 star restaurant. Here\'s how I did it:\nI heated up peanut oil almost to smoking in my large skillet. While the oil was heating, I slathered my loins in mustard. I know it said 4 tbsp, but I just gunked it on. I also used French\'s yellow, since I had no dijon. It was great anyway! After the oil was hotter than heck, smack! I slammed the loins down in there and browned them up good. I turned them to ""brown"" all sides. I was afraid I\'d cook it too long, so I didn\'t get them totally browned. I then put them in a baking dish and dumped the oil and juices from the pan over them. After that I made my reduction sauce in the pan I cooked the loins in. I replaced the wine with chicken stock + 1 tbsp vinegar. I don\'t cook with wine. I also added two tsp of minced garlic, and I also dumped 4 tsp minced garlic on the loins while they were baking. It took about 20 - 30 minutes for the sauce to reduce and get thick. I used half and half instead of cream as well, and before I added the stock I microwaved it for 2 minutes to heat it up. \nTook out the loins, sliced one up, and dumped half the sauce on it.

She grated carrots and turnips and any other root vegetable she had and cooked them along with the chopped onions. She might add a few beans or peas as well. Any ground meat was fine - beef, veal, pork, mutton - whatever we were lucky enough to have.  Canned tomatoes did not exist then, so she had to moisten the mix with stock (usually vegetable stock with an addition of yeast extract - no soy sauce then) and chop a tomato or two if she could spare them.

Made these as a side dish for a BBQ I was hosting and the Beans were a big hit! Had several people comment how good they were. I used very lean ground beef so there wouldn\'t be grease to deal with. Only ""change"" was that I cut back the sugar to 3/4 c. Will go with 1/2 c in the future, because my opinion is they could stand to be a bit less sweet. I\'m sure the Sweet Baby Ray\'s BBQ Sauce contributed to the sweetness. As a reference, I do love sweet slaw, cornbread, etc., just think it wouldn\'t take away from the recipe using a bit less sugar. I found butter beans at Whole Foods. I had no idea butter beans and lima beans were the same thing until I opened the can then Googled it to confirm my suspicion. Frankly, I can\'t discern much, if any, difference in taste between bean varieties, especially when cooked with so many other ingredients. For that reason, if you can find them, they are a nice addition as they provide an alternative  texture, color and size compared to the other beans, which makes for a good looking dish.

Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes.\nRemove phyllo dough from package and unfold onto a baking sheet. Cover with a damp kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out.

I did change it up slightly, as I left out the butter and used Grands flaky biscuits instead of phyllo dough (I tore the biscuits apart--very easy as they flake, and managed three layers of dough that way with one container).  It worked pretty well that way, although I am sure the phyllo makes this lighter so I made a bit of a heavier dish.  I halved the recipe so we wouldn't have weeks of leftovers (it's just the two of us!).  It's quite easy, just takes a few steps.

I had a couple of cooking apples so I sliced those thinly and put them in along with about 1/4 cup applesauce left in a jar instead of the apple juice.

I browned the pork chops but baked the dish instead of finishing on stove top.  I baked it at 350 for an hour as I had effectively doubled the recipe.  It was delicious!

Then I add root vegetables -- the first time parsnips, and this time a carrot and a watermelon radish -- and add low-sodium organic chicken broth.  The chops go in next, and then I dollop apple sauce and sauerkraut on top of that.

For the comment about not sweating your egglpant, as a countrygirl, I can tell you, eggplant tends to be a bit bitter if you don't sweat it.  I would definitely not skip this step.  The comments about bitterness are likely not just attributed to the frozen spinach but also to not properly prepping the eggplant.\nWhere I work there are several folks who loath bell pepper, so to solve this problem, I substitute either anaheim or pablano pepper anywhere bell pepper is called for.  Pablano is a darker green than bell, anaheim is the same color.  Both have a mild pepper flavor but not a lot of heat.  Either will give you the color and an added kick of flavor.\nAdd a bit of garlic powder or garlic salt to the veggie mixture and spinach mixture and add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of salt to the ricotta mixture to enhance the overall flavor of the dish.

Slice the zucchini thicker, salt and put it in the oven for about 15 mins to dry it out some.  I substituted ground beef with sausage.  I used more Tomatoe paste and no water to make it nice and thick so when baking, the vegetables would add some water/moisture to it.
