This sandwich was delicious. I tweaked it a bit, but I suggest you try it however you like it. I mixed a couple teaspoons of light mayo with a couple teaspoons of Classico pesto. On top of the provolone I used, I put a thin slice of tomato. If you use deli meat, lettuce is a great addition after the sandwich is done cooking. If you use chicken breast, you may want to leave the lettuce off or toss on spinach. I'm always looking for ways to add veggies and this sandwich is just perfect for that. This is an instant regular in our house. Oh, when I need a little extra something, a sprinkle the inside of the sandwich with garlic salt.

I have a few tips though to make these sandwiches easier and healthier. For the bread, you can use any sturdy bread.  Spray one side of each slice of bread with no-stick spray before putting it on the grill. For the pesto, Classico makes a very strong jarred pesto and you only need 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of it on a sandwich, which lightens it up significantly. Sliced turkey lunch meat is easier to handle and you don't have to cook something special before hand, and thinly sliced bell peppers stay in the sandwich better. I don't usually put cheese on mine, but I put a thin slice of mozzarella on my boyfriend's turkey pesto paninis. Mozzarella is lower in fat and calories than Monterey jack.

I also use beef broth to simmer the cooked ground beef and cabbage and thicken if necessary.  Sometimes I will add cubed potatoes to make it more filling.  I always serve gravy with my Bierocks."", 'followingCount': 0}, 563179: {'rating': 4, 'followersCount': 12, 'madeRecipesCount': 100, 'favoritesCount': 184, 'dateLastModified': u'2009-08-12T14:21:24.457', 'text': u""I agree with many others--the dough is great!

I used rapid rise yeast and it was ready in 1 hour. I use a different filling for inside. I had a little dough left over and I made a few cinnamon knots---  basically my fillling recipe is the same, but with lots of spices,beef broth and  lots of garlic. I also put shredded cheddar cheese over the filling before I fold it into a pastry.We like these served with salsa. I used oregano-red pepper flakes, thyme celery seed and  celery flakes, cumin salt and pepper- worcestershire sauce 2T--so play with fillingand  if too bland you can doctored it up!', 'followingCount': 0}, 3217403: {'rating': 5, 'followersCount': 11, 'madeRecipesCount': 67, 'favoritesCount': 1068, 'dateLastModified': u'2016-11-30T23:44:01.393', 'text': u""Great recipe! Tasted wonderful! I did take a lot of liberties with this recipe, though, but I did follow the recipe as a guideline. I also halved the recipe to make 10 servings instead of 20. For the dough, I used 1 cup warm water, 2 1/4 tsp Rapid Rise yeast, 1/2 tsp sugar mixed into the water and yeast, 3/4 tsp salt, 1 cup quick oats, 2-2 1/2 cups flour, 3 tbsps melted butter, 2tbsps sugar, 2tbsps honey, 1egg. Followed the recipe's direction to make the dough, except I kneaded it for about 8 minutes before rising. For the filling, I used 1 lb ground venison, 1/2 bag of frozen spinach, 1 chopped onion, minced garlic, 2 shredded carrots, 4 oz cream cheese, salt, pepper, thyme, pinch of nutmeg and paprika. Made the filling according to the recipe's directions with my changes. Let the dough rise and filled the rounds according to the recipe. I brushed the tops of the rolls with 1 tbsp of butter before baking. I know it ends up being fairly different from the original recipe, but I feel that it earns 5 stars as written due to the directions being easy and straight-forward, and also due to the fact that you can easily change the recipe to suit your tastes. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"", 'followingCount': 0}}
